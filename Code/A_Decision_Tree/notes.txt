Mutual Information:
 MI should be 1 for the first meta-feature described below.
 Hypothesize that the position of the black king should give the most MI,
  followed by the white king, followed by the white rook. Rows
  and columns of each individual piece should give about the same amount.
 Test the amount of mutual information that each feature and each meta-feature
  give about the dataset.


Decision Tree:
 Want to perform 3 experiments:
  Use original feature vector.
  Use meta-feature vector.
  Use concatenation of original feature vector and meta-feature vector.
 Probably want to implement bagged decision trees, possibly test them against
  unbagged decision trees.


Meta-Features:
 MF1: Two types of draws possible. Encorporate these into a feature:
       1)Black can capture white rook
       2)Stalemate
      These should solve the win/draw 2 class problem
 MF2:Euclidean distance between kings (play with other distances though)
 MF3:Distance between enemy king and edge
